# Tamriel Trade Centre - macOS shell version

This is mac shell version for https://us.tamrieltradecentre.com

Need to run up this script before start up Elder Scroll Online

## install

1. create folder `bin` in /Users/yourname/
2. download both `ttc` and `ttc-auto` and put them under /Users/yourname//bin
3. grant executable permission to these 2 files by using below commands in console:
```bash
cd ~/bin
chmod +x ttc
chmod +x ttc-auto
```
4. run `ttc-auto` each time before running ESO. Or you could create a shortcut icon for it in macOS desktop somewhere
